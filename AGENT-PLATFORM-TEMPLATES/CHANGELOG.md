## [2.36.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Backwards compatibility policy** — every expert agent and playbook now checks for BC breaks before writing any code. A structured `⚠️ BC BREAK` notice (what changes, who is affected, severity, migration path) is required and blocks implementation until explicitly approved. Defined once in `BEST-PRACTICES.md`; enforced across all 9 experts, the Critic `[BC]` dimension, and 5 playbooks (add-feature, bug-fix, api-integration, release, refactor).
- **Critic `[BC]` review dimension** — 8th dimension added to the adversarial review. Checks API contract changes, field removals, env/config renames, exported interface changes, auth mechanism changes, and whether the BC notice was issued and approved. Non-migratable break = Critical; undocumented migratable break = High.
- **Team adoption presentation** — `presentation/team-adoption.html` (12-slide deck) and `presentation/STORY-PLAN.md` (story beats, live demo script, objection handling) for onboarding developer teams.

### Changed
- **Release playbook BC scan** — Step 3b now scans all commits since last tag for BC breaks before semver determination. Any BC break forces a Major bump; blocks if bump is downgraded without explicit approval.
- **Cursor multi-model documentation** — `.cursor/README.md` and `SYNC-POINTS.md` now document that model switches within Cursor (GPT-4o → Claude → Gemini) are invisible to the platform and should be treated as mini-handoffs: run session-end before switching models mid-task.

<!-- ─── VERSION HISTORY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Copy this block for each release (newest version always at the top):

## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- New capability that users can now do, didn't exist before

### Changed
- Existing behavior that works differently now (describe the delta, not the implementation)

### Deprecated
- Feature still works but will be removed in a future version — include migration path

### Removed
- Feature or endpoint removed; describe the replacement if one exists

### Fixed
- Bug that was affecting users: what broke, under what condition, now resolved

### Security
- Vulnerability patched (include CVE identifier if applicable)

─── AUTHORING RULES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✓  One line per change — if a change needs a paragraph, it belongs in the release notes
✓  User-visible only — skip internal refactors, test updates, CI tweaks unless they affect behavior
✓  Omit empty sections — if nothing was removed, drop the Removed section entirely
✓  Breaking changes → put in Removed or Changed AND mark clearly: "⚠ Breaking:"
✓  Link to issues/PRs inline where relevant: "Fixed crash on empty input (#123)"
✓  Use past tense: "Added", "Fixed", "Removed" — not "Adds", "Fixes", "Removes"
✓  Semver bump guide: Added/Changed new behavior = minor · Fixed only = patch · Breaking = major
